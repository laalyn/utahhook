---- FIXME RIGHT NOW ----
Severe:
    CreateMove: make sure not left on chocke when dead
Important:
    CreateMove, other: manage chocke usage and have a priority system, mb dt will work after this
    RageBot: Why is viewport jumping around sometimes, quality check closest to crosshair
    CreateMove: Add a mode for casual where all *packetChocke usage is disabled to avoid vac error
Semi-Important:
    AntiAim: make an actual at the target, plus align left/right ovverrides; maybe 'fake' jitter too
    README: make a features list, with markers for reliability e.g. p100, stable, unstable, problematic, unknown, outdated, new
Other:
    Resolver: paste a new one in
    RageBot: make dt work
    Misc: paste slowwalk


---- TIPS FOR CODING ----
*sendPacket can only be used at CreateMove hook, because its on the stack
*sendPacket can only be changed once per twice, a tick is one CreateMove call after the if (cmd->...) statement
when *sendPacket is false, user actions will be stacked up and sent when *sendPacket is true once again
otherwise user actions will be constantly polled and simulated by server pyshics engine


---- KNOWN ISSUES THAT WONT BE FIXED SOON ----
Severe:
    RageBot: silent aim will severely hinder aiming accuracy
